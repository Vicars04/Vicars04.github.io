    <td>As usual this lesson we went on codecademy and did work on that. However at the start of this lesson I had to overcome the issue that had stumped me last week. I solved the problem by putting a lot of thought into it and carefully reading what the text said when I got it wrong, I kept making small corrections which eventually made the code correct.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Towards the end of the lesson I came across some code that I couldn't figure out how to work so I couldn't progress on from that point. This is because I didn't fully understand the code and it was in general very complicated. I need to improve on getting properly focused on the task so I can do bits with my trial and error and focus on what is wrong with my work and how I can get it right.</td>
