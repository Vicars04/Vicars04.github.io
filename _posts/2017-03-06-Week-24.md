    <td>Today we spent most of the lesson at the front of the classroom learning or working on our blogs so there was no time for codecademy. We looked at our teachers blog and how you can customize your blog. We also learnt that small errors, such as spelling mistakes can really damage your code.</td>

    <td>The complexity of raw code makes me struggle small corrections which will make my blog even better. I also lose track of how do something which is annoying as I then don't know how to do it. This problem is probably cause by my memory loss issues.</td>
