    <td>I learnt by as usual completing the task that was set by reading the instructions. I found that doing the simple stuff works, by looking at what needs to be done and completing it with minimal complexity. This helped me work quickly. I also did not tend to make many errors until I was completely stuck on one task.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As I was doing it quite quickly I found that I forgot how to do it all and got stuck on one of the more complicated questions. I need to improve by paying more attention to the code so I remember it for more of the tough stages.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will pay more attention to the work so I remember how to do all of it and so my knowledge for coding in python improves.</td>
