In this lesson we created n online shop were we could decide what clothes and prices we sold. 

We were challenged to create a online shop were you could type in any item in a box and any quantity in another ad be given a price without having to do any multiplying.

In my shop I created a buy 1 get one free offer by using if statements and equal to starlets I completed this but I was unable to complete the original challenge due to the time given to us.
