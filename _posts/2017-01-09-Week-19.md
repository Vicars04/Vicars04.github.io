    <td>In this lesson I learned from watching a video of a boy continuously attempting to jump over a horse but failing that you should never laugh or jeer at your peers or classmates when they fail, you should always encourage them on so they do not give up but instead keep trying until they succeed. In the video when the boys classmates encouraged he kept on going even though he started crying he still continued, after many attempts the boy succeed and jumped cleanly over the horse.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I felt bad for all the times that I jeered, laughed or sniggered at people after they failed or made a mistake in something, meaning they could become upset or make them feel like they should give up.</td>

    <td>What will I change?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try to stop jeering, laughing or sniggering at people especially in the lunch hall when people drop their trays and food on the floor because it is very embarrassing when it happens to you.</td>
