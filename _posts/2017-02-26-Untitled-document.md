    <td>On codecademy we did python coding, which if you followed the instructions it was pretty simple. As you can see in the picture the example of code and instructions were on the left, In the main body of the of the page there is where you write the code and the black box on the right is where the outcome and the checking of your code is shown/done. Once you have complete the task you click the blue box which says save and submit code it then checks if your code is correct or not if it is you can get onto the next task. If not you have to do it again but correctly.</td>

    <td>My typing skills slowed me down as I would spell something wrong so the code would be incorrect and I would have to do it again and correct my mistakes. I need to pay more attention to what I am writing.</td>
